# HTML-CSS-Practice
This repository contains my practice projects built with **HTML** and **CSS**. It's purpose is to showcase my learning journey and improvement in front-end development. Each folder includes a small project demonstrating different concepts of web design, styling, and layouts. Through these projects, I am practicing how to create clean, responsive and visually appealing web pages.
